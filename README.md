**Neophasia** *project code and data for Chris Hamm's part

Using data provided by KB, 12 Type I landmarks for each wing (appears to be right wing), males only. 

Based on discussions with KB I thought that a linear discriminant analysis and discriminant function would be good additions. 

Files in the repo:
** *Neophasia_code.R
** *Neophasia_raw_data.txt *Tab-delimited data

Population Key and sample sizes:
dp = Donner Pass (univoltine), 23

me = Mendocino Pass Early (early flight at two flight location), 40
ml = Mendocino Pass Late (late flight at two flight location), 20
